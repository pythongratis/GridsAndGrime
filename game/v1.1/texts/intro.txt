You have woken in somekind of cave or dungeon. You don't know where you are and you need to get out of here. At least you have some few basic things such as a dagger, 150 coins and a potion. You don't know what the potion does, but you may want to keep it - It may be useful. You can move around and use your items in any room. You may find a few things along the way. Good luck explorer.

What do you want to do?
