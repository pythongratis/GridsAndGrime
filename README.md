Grids And Grime
=============

Grids And Grime is a text-only, single-player python game that challenges the player's patience, problem solving and exploring skills.

The aim of the game is to get out of the place that you find yourself in, completing challenges and puzzles as you progress.
Full of misleading items and dead-ends, a big challenge awaits.

Suggestions for the next versions are welcome and thank you for supporting this project!
